# altura-assessement

## this project is created using reactjs and stylied using tailwindcss for faster development

### No state management tool was used because this is a small application and passing props is enough,axios was used 
 for data fetching and react icons was used for the icons 
## moralis APi was used for fetching nft balances read docs here https://docs.moralis.io/web3-data-api/reference/get-wallet-nfts

* error states
* more styling
* connect wallet to automatically fetch user nft
